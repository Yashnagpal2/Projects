# Spam Mail Detection Project

## Overview

This project is designed to detect spam emails using machine learning, specifically leveraging the logistic regression algorithm. The system categorizes emails as either "spam" or "ham" based on a set of features, enhancing email security and minimizing the impact of unwanted messages.

## Key Features

Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression
Email Classification: Determines whether a given email is spam or ham.

## How it Works
### Training:

The project includes a Python script for training the logistic regression model using a labeled dataset.

### Prediction:

The trained model can be used to predict whether a new email is spam or ham, helping users filter out unwanted content.

## Dependencies

Python (with scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy)

## Contributions

Contributions are encouraged! Feel free to open issues, provide feedback, or submit pull requests to improve the effectiveness of the spam mail detection system.
